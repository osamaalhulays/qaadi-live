## Summary
This document outlines the proposed theoretical framework and its main hypotheses.

## Keywords
- framework
- analysis

## Tokens and Definitions
- c: speed of light
- m: mass

## Boundary Conditions
- t = 0 : initial state of the system
- x -> âˆž : energy dissipation approaches zero

## Post-Analysis
All equations are dimensionally homogeneous, satisfying [E] = [M][L]^2[T]^{-2].

## Risks
- excessive simplification may mislead
- valid only below light speed

## Predictions
Expected behaviour of the model and how it might be observed.

## Testability
Conditions or experiments necessary to verify the hypotheses.

## Overflow Log
- none
