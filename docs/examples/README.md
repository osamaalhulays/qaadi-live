# Example Data

This directory contains experimental sample data used in tests and documentation.
The `theory-demo` set mirrors the `QaadiDB` and `QaadiVault` structures with
minimal registry, canonical and fingerprint files for the `demo` theory. These
files exist only for examples and automated tests, never for production use.
