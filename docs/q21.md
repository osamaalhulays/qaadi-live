# Q21 Standard

Q21 defines a lightweight mapping between raw data and canonical labels. It is
used to normalize units and figure types before reports are generated.

## Maps

- **units → dimensional** – convert unit symbols into dimensional categories.
- **figures → diagrams** – convert figure keywords into diagram styles.

Both maps live in `src/lib/q21.ts` and can be imported individually or through
the `Q21` object.

## Usage

```ts
import { unitsToDimensional, mergeQ21Fields } from "@/lib/q21";

const report = { units: "m", figure: "bar", value: 42 };
const merged = mergeQ21Fields(report);
// merged.dimensional === "length" and merged.diagram === "bar diagram"
```

The `mergeQ21Fields` helper demonstrates how Q21 data can be merged into report
structures so that downstream consumers receive normalized fields.
