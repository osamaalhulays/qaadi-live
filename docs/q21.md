# QN21 Evaluation

The QN21 standard defines twentyâ€‘one quality criteria. Each criterion is
identified by a short `code`, marked as either **internal** or **external**, and
assigned a `weight` that contributes to the final score. The current project
uses a uniform weight of `1` for all criteria.

| Code | Type | Weight | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| I1 | internal | 1 | Clear objectives |
| I2 | internal | 1 | Logical structure |
| I3 | internal | 1 | Evidence of planning |
| I4 | internal | 1 | Resource allocation |
| I5 | internal | 1 | Defined responsibilities |
| I6 | internal | 1 | Monitoring mechanisms |
| I7 | internal | 1 | Risk assessment |
| I8 | internal | 1 | Stakeholder mapping |
| I9 | internal | 1 | Training program |
| I10 | internal | 1 | Documentation |
| E1 | external | 1 | Public transparency |
| E2 | external | 1 | Accessibility |
| E3 | external | 1 | Community feedback |
| E4 | external | 1 | Regulatory compliance |
| E5 | external | 1 | Performance reporting |
| E6 | external | 1 | Environmental impact |
| E7 | external | 1 | Data privacy |
| E8 | external | 1 | User satisfaction |
| E9 | external | 1 | Interoperability |
| E10 | external | 1 | Security posture |
| E11 | external | 1 | Community engagement |

## Scoring

The `evaluateQN21(text)` helper scans the supplied text for each criterion's
`code` (case insensitive). When a code is found, the criterion receives its full
`weight`; otherwise the score is `0`. The `gap` is calculated as
`weight - score`, indicating how many points remain to fulfill the criterion.
