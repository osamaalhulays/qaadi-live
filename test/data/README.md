# Test Data

This directory provides experimental sample data for the test suite. The
`theory-demo` set mirrors the `QaadiDB` and `QaadiVault` structures with minimal
registry, canonical and fingerprint files for the `demo` theory. These files are
used only for tests and examples, not for production.
